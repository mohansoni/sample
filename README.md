# sample
# This Swift project demonstrates asynchronous image loading with an integrated caching mechanism, all without relying on third-party libraries. It utilizes the UnSplash API for fetching data and displaying images within the application.

# Steps to run the project.

Running iOS code in Xcode involves several steps. Here's a general outline:

1. **Set Up Xcode**: If you haven't already, download and install Xcode from the Mac App Store. Xcode is the official IDE for iOS development.

2. **Open Xcode**: Launch Xcode on your Mac.

3. **Open or Create a Project**: You can either open an existing project or create a new one. To create a new project, go to File > New > Project, then choose the appropriate template for your iOS application (e.g., Single View App, Tabbed App, etc.).

4. **Import Code**: If you have existing iOS code that you want to run, you'll need to import it into your Xcode project. You can do this by dragging and dropping the code files into the project navigator in Xcode.

5. **Resolve Dependencies**: If your code relies on external libraries or frameworks, you'll need to add them to your Xcode project. This usually involves adding them via CocoaPods, Carthage, or Swift Package Manager, depending on how the dependencies are managed.

6. **Configure Build Settings**: Ensure that the build settings for your project are correctly configured. This includes things like setting the deployment target, selecting the correct provisioning profile, and configuring any necessary build flags.

7. **Select Target Device**: In Xcode, you can run your iOS app on a simulator or a physical device. To run on a simulator, choose one from the list of available simulators in the toolbar. To run on a physical device, connect the device to your Mac and select it from the list of available devices.

8. **Build and Run**: Once everything is set up, you can build and run your app by clicking the "Play" button (▶️) in the toolbar. Xcode will compile your code, package it into an iOS app, and launch it on the selected target device.

9. **Debugging**: If your app encounters any issues while running, you can use Xcode's built-in debugging tools to diagnose and fix the problems. This includes features like breakpoints, the debugger console, and the visual debugger.

10. **Testing**: Once your app is running smoothly, it's a good idea to test it thoroughly to ensure that it behaves as expected on different devices and under various conditions.

Following these steps should help you run your iOS code in Xcode effectively. If you encounter any specific issues or error messages along the way, feel free to ask for further assistance!
